This course is part of the Coursera Java Specialization given in the Duke University, as I've been learning Java in Venezuela at my University UCLA, in the courses "Laboratorio 1" and "Laboratorio 2", Also I've been learning Data Structures there, they teach us dynamic memory with pointers, linked list, double linked list, queues, stacks, recursion, trees, this the content of the first course.

I want with this courses complement the basic of what I know about Java, and Data Structures.
